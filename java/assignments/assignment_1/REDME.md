Reflection in Java

Reflection is an API which is used to examine or modify the behavior of methods, classes, interfaces at runtime.

The required classes for reflection are provided under java.lang.reflect package.
Reflection gives us information about the class to which an object belongs and also the methods of that class which can be executed by using the object.
Through reflection we can invoke methods at runtime irrespective of the access specifier used with them.

Reflection is the ability of a program to analyze itself. The java.lang.reflect package provides the ability to obtain the information about the fields,constructors,methods, and modifiers of a class.Normally such information is needed to build software tools that enable us to do work with Java Beans components. The tools use reflection to determine dynamically the characteristics of a component.
Java reflection is useful because it supports dynamic retrieval of information about classes and data structures by name, and allows for their manipulation wityhin an executing Java program.This feature is extremely powerful and has no equivalent in other convectional languages such as C,C++,Fortan,or pascal.
Advantages of Reflection

Extensibility features
Debugging & Testing tools
Drawbacks of Reflection

Reflection is a powerful tool to inspect the code.It helps in debugging .Its can be used to modify the runtime behavior of the application running in JVM. But it should not be used often, because it is comes with some disadvantages.
Performance Overhead
Security Restrictions
